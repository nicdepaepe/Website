			<p> I'd like to think of myself as a creative and pro-active entrepreneurial type of person. While I was still going to school to acquire the basics of graphic design, illustrating and painting, I was already experimenting with webdesign and social media marketing, setting up minor ventures into online selling, learning about branding and market positioning on the go.
			</p>

			<p> Lately I've also been setting up a YouTube channel, learning the basics of video editing in doing so. Since a large portion of the online world is set up in English, I quickly got almost as fluent in English as I am in Dutch (my mother tongue). Learning the basics in school, I'm currently also delving deeper into French,
			as well as - through personal interests - Korean and Chinese.
